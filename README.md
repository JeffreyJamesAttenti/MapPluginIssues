# Map Plugin Issues

This is a demo of an issue with cordova-plugin-googlemaps in an ionic project where a map displayed on a modal view doesn't allow events to propagate to the native map. For example, you can't drag the map or press a marker.

Steps to reproduce issue:

* Press _Open Map_ button on first screen
* Try to drag the map that's displayed on the modal screen
* Try to press marker
